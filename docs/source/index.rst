Nanos documentation
===================

**Nanos** is a python library that contains collection of small utilities. The
main idea behind this project is to have an easy and fast access to various
useful functions and classes that otherwise would have been copied and pasted
from one project to another.

The library has zero dependencies and relies only on built-in python modules.
